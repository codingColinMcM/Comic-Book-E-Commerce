## Description

Welcome to Comic Book Exchange. This is a collaborative MERN-Stack application that lets verified users create posts to sell comic books that others can place a bid on in order to purchase it. We wanted to make a website that was specifically tailored for comic books since there are thousands of books and it can be difficult to find a great deal. Throughout this project we developed our front-end abilities for React and strengthen our experience in data and user demand.
